# Instruction
First Check whether you have “D” Drive in your System. If you have “D” 
Drive, then it’s not required to do the following steps. If you don’t have “D” 
Drive then it’s required to follow the things to be done before executing the 
project.
* Go to the Source Code Location 
“SOURCE CODE\QRVotingSystem\src\java\QRVoting\Elections”
* Where you can find “UserApprove.java” file.
* Open it in Netbeans (or) Notepad++, then go to the line number 55.
* Where you can find "D://QRVoting". Now as you don’t have “D” Drive in 
your system you need to change the path If you have Only “C” Drive then you 
cannot replace D with C because you have Operating System installed in the C 
Drive, so you cannot create a Read / Write file in it. 
So insert a Pen drive so that a new drive will be created, then replace the 
location in the line number 55 with the new drive name.
